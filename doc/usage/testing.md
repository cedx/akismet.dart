# Testing
When you will integrate the library with your own application, you will of course need to test it. Often we see developers get ahead of themselves, making a few trivial API calls with minimal values and drawing the wrong conclusions about Akismet's accuracy.

## Simulate a positive (spam) result
Make a [comment check](../features/comment_check.md) API call with the `Author#name` set to `"viagra-test-123"` or `Author#email` set to `"akismet-guaranteed-spam@example.com"`. Populate all other required fields with typical values.

The Akismet API will always return a `true` response to a valid request with one of those values. If you receive anything else, something is wrong in your client, data, or communications.

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:akismet/akismet.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final author = Author('127.0.0.1', 'Mozilla/5.0', name: 'viagra-test-123');
  final comment = Comment(author, content: 'A user comment');

  final client = Client('123YourAPIKey', Blog(Uri.https('www.yourblog.com', '/')));
  final isSpam = await client.checkComment(comment);
  print('It should be "true": $isSpam');
}
```

## Simulate a negative (not spam) result
Make a [comment check](../features/comment_check.md) API call with the `Author#role` set to `"administrator"` and all other required fields populated with typical values.

The Akismet API will always return a `false` response. Any other response indicates a data or communication problem.

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:akismet/akismet.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final author = Author('127.0.0.1', 'Mozilla/5.0', role: 'administrator');
  final comment = Comment(author, content: 'A user comment');

  final client = Client('123YourAPIKey', Blog(Uri.https('www.yourblog.com', '/')));
  final isSpam = await client.checkComment(comment);
  print('It should be "false": $isSpam');
}
```

## Automated testing
Enable the `Client#isTest` option in your tests.

That will tell Akismet not to change its behaviour based on those API calls â€“ they will have no training effect. That means your tests will be somewhat repeatable, in the sense that one test won't influence subsequent calls.

```dart
import 'dart:async';
import 'package:akismet/akismet.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final author = Author('127.0.0.1', 'Mozilla/5.0');
  final comment = Comment(author, content: 'A user comment');

  final client = Client('123YourAPIKey', Blog(Uri.https('www.yourblog.com', '/')), isTest: true);
  print('It should not influence subsequent calls');
  await client.checkComment(comment);
}
```
